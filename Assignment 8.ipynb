    "Ques 2.) Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi ?\n",

    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "The import statement import pyinputplus as pypi is commonly used to import PyInputPlus with an alias pypi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an alias allows us to refer to the PyInputPlus library with a shorter and more convenient name within our code. It \n",
    "helps in reducing the amount of typing required to access the library's functions and classes. Instead of typing pyinputplus.\n",
    "some_function(), we can simply use pypi.some_function().\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the alias pypi is arbitrary and can be any valid Python identifier. In this case, pypi might have been chosen\n",
    "to resemble the commonly used abbreviation for the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is the official repository for Python\n",
    "packages. However, it's important to note that the pypi alias used when importing PyInputPlus has no direct connection to the \n",
    "Python Package Index. It's simply a common choice for a shorter and more readable alias."

    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "In PyInputPlus, the functions inputInt() and inputFloat() are used to take user input and ensure that the input is a valid \n",

    "To distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat(), we need to consider the type of number we expect the user to enter.\n",
